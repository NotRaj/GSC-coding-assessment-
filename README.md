The file GSC_A1 is the first problem in the assemsent, I did it in python because it would be illogical to do it in c++ given the ease of use python has with API calls.

The file GSC_A2 contains the second problem done in C++ it is a quick sort algo implementation and then finding the median of the sorted array.
